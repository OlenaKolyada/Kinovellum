## 2. Business Functions (Methods)

### CRUDS for Entries

    * Business rule: Only authenticated users can create entries
    * Constraints:
        * Required fields: movieId, viewingDate
        * Rating must be in range 1-10
        * Viewing date cannot be in the future
    * Validation: Check movie existence in database

2. **`entry.read`** - Get entry information
   * Business rule: User can view only their own entries
   * Returns: Complete entry information with movie data

3. **`entry.update`** - Update an existing entry
    * Business rule: Only owner can modify their entry
    * Constraints: Cannot change userId and movieId
    * Validation: Access rights verification

4. **`entry.delete`** - Delete an entry

5. **`entry.search`** - Search user's entries by criteria
   * Business logic: Returns current user's entries with applied filters
   * Filters:
      - By specific movie (movieId)
      - By viewing date range (dateFrom, dateTo)
      - By rating
   * Sorting: By viewing date (default: newest to oldest), by rating
   * Returns: List of entries matching search criteria
   * Usage: Universal method for getting entry lists and repeat viewing history

### Methods for Movies

6. **`movie.search`** - Search and automatic movie addition
   * Business logic: Search movies by title first in local database, if not found - query TMDb API with automatic saving of found results to local database
   * Filters: By title, release year, genre
   * Returns: List of movies with basic information
   * Note: Method performs implicit movie record creation (implicit create)

7. **`movie.read`** - Get detailed movie information
   * Business logic: Returns complete movie information from local database
   * Returns: Detailed movie information

**Note:** Full CRUD for movies (create, update, delete for administrators) is planned for implementation in future project iterations.
